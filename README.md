# ij_Geometry
Geometry library for ImageJ.

The aim of this library is to provide a set of tools for geometric computing, 
facilitating their use for 2D/3D image processing with ImageJ.

The project is based on maven. It uses sci-java as parent configuration. The parent configuration 
is somewhat old (1.126), but I encountered configuration troubles with more recent ones. 

The base configuration has few dependencies:

* ImageJ
* JUnit
